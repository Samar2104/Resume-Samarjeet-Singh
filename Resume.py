- ‚ñ∫ The aim of this project is to develop a web-based application that predicts the revenue grid for a given customer based on various parameters.The predictive model is built using the Random Forest algorithm, which is known for its accuracy and ability to handle large datasets with multiple features.   
- ‚ñ∫ The application is designed using Streamlit, which is an open-source Python library that allows for the creation of interactive web applications. Users can enter customer information into the app, and the machine learning model will make predictions on the revenue grid for that customer.
- ‚ñ∫ The Revenue Grid Predictor using Random Forest and Streamlit will provide businesses with an efficient way to predict the revenue grid for their customers, allowing them to make data-driven decisions and improve their sales strategy. The application will be accessible on the cloud, making it easy for 
businesses to use the tool and leverage its benefits.
